Simple Login Page Implementation in Python:

This Python script implements a basic login system that prompts users for a username and a password, along with a confirmation for the password.

Features:

Username Input: Users are prompted to enter their username.

Password Confirmation: Users must enter a password and confirm it by entering it again.

Attempt Limitation: Users are allowed up to three attempts to enter matching passwords.

Feedback: The system provides feedback on whether the login was successful or if the user should try again.

Code Walkthrough:

Initial Inputs: The program begins by asking for a username and password.

Password Confirmation Check: If the entered password matches the confirmation, the login is successful.

Retry Mechanism: If the passwords do not match, users have a maximum of three attempts to enter matching passwords.

Feedback Messages: The program informs users whether the login was successful or if they should try again. If the maximum attempts are reached, a message is displayed indicating too many attempts.
